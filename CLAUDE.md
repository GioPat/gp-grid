- Avoid using `any`
- The library `core` package must be library/framework agnostic
- The library comes with batteries: There are two wrappers (react and vue) in the `packages` folder and they shall always be kept aligned with each other.
- When you need to run the playground, use `pnpm --filter=playground dev`
- Check LSP type errors
